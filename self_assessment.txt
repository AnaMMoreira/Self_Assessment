Rats Sightings in NYC: 

Data Analysis of publicly accessible data from NYC was used to identify major factors contributing to the increasing rat population. 

Model Development included Supervised Learning Models, both Linear and Classifiers.  All models were run and tested and the logistic Model and Balanced Random Model Classifier were selected 

Model results were then showcased, and the original questions were addressed regarding major factors possibly affecting rat sightings in NYC

A list of features helped identify that certain types of land use and organic trash generated were the most influential areal characteristics.
I suspect these can be translated into population density as the ultimate factor.
 
Further a very cool Dashboard was developed. 
Our work can be visualized by New York City residents via an interactive Tableau dashboard.
